# Refined Web Reader

NOTE: This README file is generated by Claude, so there could be some errors. I'm working my way through the specifics. 

Refined Web Reader is a Flask-based web application that allows users to fetch articles from the web, transform them into a clean, readable format, and interact with the content using LLM-powered queries. The app also provides functionality to save articles as PDFs. This is a very early POC and should not be considered a full-fledged application. 

## Features

- Fetch and parse web articles (currently all text, no media such as images or video)
- Display articles
- Query article content using an LLM (currently OpenAI gpt 3.5 turbo)
- Generate PDF versions of articles (currently quite ugly looking) 

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following: 

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- An OpenAI API key

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up Refined Web Reader locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/francisgreenleaf/reader.git
   cd reader
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install flask python-dotenv newspaper3k reportlab llama-index langchain langchain_community openai lxml_html_clean
   ```

5. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory
   - Add your OpenAI API key to the file:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage

To run the Refined Web Reader:

1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app_v2.6.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

4. Use the interface to:
   - Enter a URL to fetch an article
   - Read the formatted article
   - Generate a PDF of the article
   - Query the article content using AI
